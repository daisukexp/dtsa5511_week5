### Introduction
This project is based on Kaggle competition, "I’m Something of a Painter Myself" that explores the intersection of art and technology, leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to replicate the distinctive artistic style of Claude Monet. GANs, pivotal in the advancements of computer vision, consist of generator and discriminator neural networks, working in tandem yet with opposing goals. The generator strives to create images, in this case in the style of Monet.

This competition challenges participants to construct a GAN capable of producing 7,000 to 10,000 images mirroring Monet’s unique artistic essence, exploring the potential of data science in mimicking intricate artistic styles traditionally perceived as solely human endeavors.
